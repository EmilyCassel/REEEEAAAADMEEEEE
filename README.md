## Description
This application is to assist in generating a professional ReadMe.md for projects quickly but in a professional manner and in proper format

## Motivation for Development
The motivation for development was that a professional ReadMe generator that answers these questions without me having to retype the basics and automatically fills them in would be a time saver

## User Story
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Technologies Used: 
This project uses javascript, inquirer and fs


## Challenges 
One of my main challenges was I wasnâ€™t sure where to find the license information

## Successes
a success was that I was able to complete a lot of the markdown data on my own and find most of my own errors as well complete 2/3 of the script.js without assistance

## Directions for Future Development
More questions would make this more detailed 
It might be helpful to include more license types
